# IE-Omics
IE-Omics is a R script that automates “iterative exclusion” (IE) experiments for Thermo instruments. This script can easily be modified for use with other instruments. IE-Omics applies Iterative exclusion to traditional data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry top N experiments (ddMS2-topN), where the N most intense ions detected in a full scan are selected for fragmentation. In IE, previously selected ions for fragmentation using ddMS2-topN are excluded from selection in sequential injections. Theoretically fragmentation of all ions above a certain intensity threshold can be acquired. Applying this technique in our laboratory to Red Cross plasma and substantia nigra, we were able to identify up to 69 % more lipids than using traditional data-dependent acquisition.
